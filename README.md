# Code Zen Track Action

A Github action that responds with jokes, motivational quotes or any advice from your favourite character using GPT API leveraging the Github API to analyze the developer's GitHub history. This can be really helpful for developers to maintain their code zen by providing helpful suggestions to help them avoid burnout and frustration.

It aims to prioritise mental health and provide tailored prompts and responses to empower developers in their journey towards better well-being, productivity, and overall satisfaction.

## Background

Developers tend to be highly invested in their work at times and forget to take occasional breaks or get anxious over a lot of things. It could be maybe if a ci/cd pipeline keeps failing or they feel their github contributions are not getting appreciated. Feeling under appreciated might make the devs lose their motivation. So similar to apps that remind devs to take a break, this github action can provide suggestions based on the user github history and be scheduled to trigger in periodic intervals and create an issue in the repo ! But instead of just receiving a generic recommendation, you can set the words to follow the pattern of your favorite character , set the tone and define whether you want some wise words or a joke or even just honest opinion 

The actions takes the following inputs to engineer the right prompt and response
  
  #### Action Input
  
  - persona (x character from y show)
  
  - github-input (Type of data to be fetched from Github API (issues, repos, commits, PRs, contributions))
  
  - action (Judge, Joke, Quote, one liner, advice, reminder)

  - tone (Sarcastic, Jovial, Friendly)

  - contribution-period (in days)

  - output-length (Set length of the output response in words less than 128)
 
 #### Action Output
  
 - prompt

 - response
